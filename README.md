HELLO. This is my first ever project on a webgame. This game is targetted for people that can click a mouse button, 
type in numbers and remember a string of numbers.

I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript/jQuery to make the game. The game just pops up numbers for users to remember. 
Everytime the user press play, it adds a digit and it gets harder and harder up until you don't want to play anymore :)
